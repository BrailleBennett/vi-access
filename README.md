# Visually Impaired Access Mods

[![Built on Fabulously Optimized](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/built-with/fabulously-optimized_64h.png)](https://download.fo)

## What is this?

This pack aims to provide blind or visually impaired players with many mods to assist them in enjoying Minecraft to its fullest potential. The main mod in this pack is [Minecraft Access](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access), which provides essential information to players who are unable to see on their own.
Check out the [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/modpack/vi-access) for the pack.
You can find a detailed accessibility friendly instalation guide [here](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access/blob/1.21/docs/setup/modpack.md)

### Accessibility tweaks
Some of the accessibility features and mods included are:
- Toggling high contrast, full screen, directional audio, and narrator to true by default

### Performance Mods

This modpack is a fork of [Fabulously Optimized](https://download.fo). Visually Impaired Access includes all mods from that pack in addition to the accessibility mods added here.

## Who is this for?

This pack is intended for users who play Minecraft Fabric 1.21 and want to install accessibility improvements and optimizations on their clients.

## Custom Keybinds

- Delete key - toggle only attack when the attack cooldown is full (default is off)
- Z - toggle gamma between maximum and default options
- X - toggle night vision like gamma effect
- C - hold to zoom in, release to return to default zoom.
- V - toggle being able to strip logs (default is stripping enabled)
- B - narrate the current target with Jade
- N - Narrate the current target with Minecraft Access
- Right Control - open the Jade configuration menu
- up arrow - increase gamma by 10
- down arrow - decrease gamma by 10
- Several keys from jade and other modpack bundled mods were unbound by default because they interfered with keys from Minecraft Access, you can rebind them in the controls settings.

## Things to Note

This pack is still very much in its early stages. I would love for you to join the Discord server and post in #mc-general about any mod suggestions or feedback you have.

We also plan on adding many more mods to assist low vision users by making certain UI elements larger, providing more visual cues when in-game actions take place, and more.
